### Codes published on this account ðŸ”­
This account mainly publishes the REVIVE USB series repository.  
These are my unofficial modifications to the firmware on PIC MCUs of hardware products from Bit Trade One, Inc. in Japan.  
Some code has been officially merged.

### What do you usually do? ðŸ’¬
I stay at home listening to music and watching VTubers.  
My favorite genre of music is happy hardcore. Because it puts me in the happiest mood!  

I am an engineer specializing in web development, but I usually develop games.  
Therefore, I basically develop in any genre.
